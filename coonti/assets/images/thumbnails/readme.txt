Usage
-----
There are .ico (up to 256x256) and transparent .png (256x256) included.

If yo need more there is a template as well. You will need Photoshop and/or Illustrator. Open iconGrid_illustrator.psd or iconGrid_photoshop and double click any layer with an icon. The layers are Smart Objects so you can edit the content of one and the rest will adapt.

Quick tip: You can create and use a Photoshop action to save each size on the desktop with one click.
